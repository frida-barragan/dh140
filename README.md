# Hi! My name is Frida Barragan!
I am a fourth year Biology major at UCLA. My interests lie mostly in the **healthcare industry** and **accessibility to health services**. My advocacy for medical accessibility resulted from my volunteering as a Spanish interpreter for local Santa Monica clinics. That opportunity allowed me to understand how many people unfortunately lack access to basic medical services that would greatly improve their livelihood. 

### Coding for Digital Humanities 140 
Application of structural elements, including loops, dictionaries, if statements, etc, in research. Creation of a project in the humanities and social sciences to showcase management and visual representations of data sets.

### Project ideas
The project I am interested in conducting is in the topic of health care and accessibility. For this project, I will create a map and add a pin in the respective coordinates for each clinic in Los Angeles county. In the same map I will use a gradient of colors to depict the average income of each city within the Los Angeles county area. The map with these two data sets will create an image of what the distribution of clinics is compared to the income of an area.
