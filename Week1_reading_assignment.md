The article "Explore the Role of Coding in Data Science and Analytics" talks about what data science is and what is its importance. According to the article, data science is highly applicable to any field that uses sets of data. Various skills needed for being successful in data science are mentioned, including knowledge in programming and visualizations. The article also includes a potential process of data science and the steps usually required in experiments relating to data sets. This article reports that the first step of a sata science experiment is planning and designing an experiment, followed by obtaining and cleaning the appropriate data, and lastly analyzing and visualizing the data. Some of the programming languages and tools such as Python to obtain and clean data, packages like numpy and pandas for data matrix calculations and MATLAB for data analysis are explained. The article concludes with a couple of case studies in which data science has been utilized and how the field is expanding.

From the articles I read online, this article spoke the most to me because I felt like its approach to data science and coding is really thorough and set up an explanation that is easy to follow and understand. The article explains the function of data science and how the process can be done which I think is really helpful to have an idea of how a project involving data sets should be planned and done. This article informs my goals for data science with its explanation of the different uses for data sets and its vast application in various fields. Also, the different tools and programming languages are very helpful because it helped me get an idea of the resources available for my project and what direction I can take my project to take advantage of them. Finally, I think the case studies were interesting and fun to read about, it puts the importance of data science into perspective.
