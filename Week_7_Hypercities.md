# Week 7 - Individual Assignment

### My reaction

I felt surprised reading the text because I was not aware of the impact social media, specifically Twitter had on the Revolutions of Egypt even when the group of Twitter users might not have been ideally representative in terms of statistics. I think that as I learn more and more about various social media platforms and their effects on society, its importance for social justice and expression becomes larger and larger. I think the network graphs are really powerful in showing the relationship between the words and show their usage in full effect when discussing Egypt in a Global View. Overall, I think the different colors, words and connections really help emphasize the movement increasing its impact on people who see these images.

### Question
In your perspective, what do you think the future of digital humanities is? What effects do you think the mapping of these historical events will have on the societies that are the points of focus?
